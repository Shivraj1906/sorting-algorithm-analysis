# Post analysis of sorting algorithms
<hr>
## Code overview
<ul>
<li> Program runs the sorting algorithms for given number of input limit. </li>
<li> Program uses [chrono](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/) library</li>
<li> Program tests algorithm for various input types such as random input (using [random library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/random)), input in ascending or descending order</li>
<li> Program generates .csv file for gathered data</li>
</ul>
